## Future Features: 

### These future features and much more were all added to James Redden's solo remake of Chef's Kiss known as [Urban Forager](https://github.com/jaredden1/The-Urban-Forager).

1. Separate frontend pages into further React Components (i.e. 'Restaurant Lists, Buttons, and Inputs')
2. Add a Show Page and implement a feature to allow users to add their impressions of a restaurant.  
3. Caching search results to avoid unnecessary fetch calls from the API.  
4. Restrict a user from saving restaurants in their list more than once. 
5. Implement Auth0 Authorization. 
6. Implement a Restaurant view that allows users to view all other users' impressions. 
7. Implement the use of an OpenAI API that aggregates and summarizes all users' impressions.
